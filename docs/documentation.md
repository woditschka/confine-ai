# Documentation Governance

<!-- AGENT: This is the authoritative source for documentation rules -->
<!-- AGENT: Read "Agent Optimization Guidelines" section before processing other docs -->
<!-- AGENT: Validation checklist at end of document for verifying compliance -->

This document defines documentation structure, writing standards, and maintenance rules for confine-ai. All contributors and agents must follow these guidelines.

## Writing Standards

All documentation, comments, and PRDs must follow these rules. Clear writing reflects clear thinking.

### Sentence Structure

- Maximum 30 words per sentence. Target 70% under 20 words.
- Use subject-verb-object form. Use strong verbs. Remove filler.
- One idea per sentence. No ambiguity.

**Replace wordy phrases:**

| Do Not Write | Write Instead |
|--------------|---------------|
| "due to the fact that" | "because" |
| "lacked the ability to" | "could not" |
| "with the possible exception of" | "except" |
| "until such time as" | "until" |
| "for the purpose of" | "for" |

### Replace Adjectives with Data

Adjectives are imprecise. Data is credible. If you cannot quantify the claim, reconsider making it.

| Do Not Write | Write Instead |
|--------------|---------------|
| "much faster" | "reduced from 10ms to 1ms" |
| "nearly all" | "87%" |
| "significantly better" | "+25 basis points" |
| "very reliable" | "99.9% uptime" |
| "sales increased significantly" | "sales increased 40% in Q4" |

### Prohibited Words

Never use without data: "significant", "substantial", "remarkable", "arguably", "might", "would help", "should result in", "some", "many", "most", "several", "various", "often", "usually", "probably", "very", "extremely", "fairly", "quite".

### Be Objective

No subjective language. No buzzwords. No unsupported claims. Data supports decision-making; adjectives do not.

### Pass the "So What?" Test

Every paragraph must justify its existence. Ask:
- If deleted, would the reader miss it?
- Does it enrich the reader's understanding?
- What are the implications?

If a paragraph fails, rewrite or remove it.

### Answer Questions Directly

Start with the answer. Do not warm up. Do not build suspense. Use one of four answers: Yes. No. A number (with context). "I don't know" (with follow-up).

### Use Inclusive Language

Use inclusive terminology. Avoid terms with exclusionary origins.

| Do Not Write | Write Instead |
|--------------|---------------|
| "whitelist" | "allowlist" |
| "blacklist" | "denylist" or "blocklist" |
| "master/slave" | "primary/replica" or "leader/follower" |
| "sanity check" | "confidence check" or "validation" |

### Avoid Jargon

Write for clarity, not exclusivity. Define technical terms on first use. Define acronyms on first use: "Product Requirements Document (PRD)". Do not assume shared context.

## Abstraction Levels (across documents)

The confine-ai documentation set is layered horizontally. Each document sits at a specific abstraction level and owns a specific concern.

| Level | Document | Concerns | Audience |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Meta** | `CLAUDE.md` | Build commands, commit conventions, agent workflow | Contributors, agents |
| **Strategic** | `docs/prd.md` | Goals, requirements, constraints, acceptance criteria | Product owners, reviewers |
| **Decision** | `docs/adr/*.md` | Design trade-offs, alternatives considered, rationale | Architects, maintainers |
| **Tactical** | `docs/system-design.md` | Architecture, patterns, guardrails, file pointers | Developers, agents |
| **Methodology** | `docs/tdd-principles.md` | TDD cycle, phase rules, design-check gate | feature-implementer agent |

Document Ownership (below) defines what each document owns and does not own. Structure Within a Document (next section) defines how to layer abstraction inside a single document.

## Structure Within a Document

Every document — and every non-trivial section within a document — is organized into 2–4 internal levels of abstraction, ordered highest to lowest. Each level is longer and more specific than the one before. A reader should be able to stop at any level and walk away with a useful understanding.

### Levels

| Level | Name | Length | Content | Audience |
|-------|------|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Executive summary (what & why) | 1–3 paragraphs, ≤200 words, narrative prose | Purpose, key conclusion or recommendation, scope. No jargon, no implementation detail. | Decision-makers, first-time readers |
| 2 | Approach and structure (how) | 3–5× Level 1 | Method, architecture, plan, reasoning. Subheadings allowed; focus on concepts over specifics. | Planners, reviewers |
| 3 | Detail (show me) | As long as needed | Full technical or operational detail: specs, data, procedures, code, evidence. Navigable; not expected to be read linearly. | Implementers |
| 4 | Reference (optional) | As long as needed | Appendices, raw data, logs, extended examples. Supports Level 3 claims; not expected to be read end-to-end. | Auditors, deep debuggers |

### Rules

1. **Each level is self-contained.** Never require a reader to go deeper to understand the current level. If a Level 1 paragraph only makes sense after reading Level 3, the Level 1 is broken.
2. **Signal what's below.** End each level with a brief pointer to the next (e.g., "Implementation details follow in Section 3"). Readers who stop at a level should know what they are choosing to skip.
3. **Scale length gradually.** Aim for a 3–5× word-count multiplier between adjacent levels. A jump from 200 words to 3,000 is too abrupt; insert a Level 2 that bridges them.
4. **Match audience to level.** Level 1 serves decision-makers, Level 2 serves planners, Levels 3–4 serve implementers. Do not mix audiences within a single level.
5. **Narrative at the top, structure at the bottom.** Level 1 reads as flowing prose. Lower levels may use lists, tables, diagrams, and headings freely.

### How this applies to confine-ai's documents

- **`docs/prd.md`.** Motivation + Primary Use Case + Goals / Non-Goals + Document map form Level 1 for the whole PRD. Functional group headings with their one-paragraph openers (e.g. CLI surface, Network isolation, Assistant management) are Level 2; the Assistant management group's Overview subsection with the mental model is a nested Level 2 for its sub-area. Individual requirements (`### REQ-XX-NNN`) are Level 3; acceptance criteria inside each requirement are supporting detail at the same level, not Level 4.
- **`docs/system-design.md`.** The Package Structure diagram and one-paragraph overview are Level 1. The headings under Types, Interfaces, CLI Command Dispatch, and Update Command act as Level 2 navigation. Per-function and per-type detail blocks are Level 3. The Implementation Order table at the end is Level 4.
- **`docs/adr/*.md`.** Context + Decision are Level 1. Rationale and Alternatives are Level 2. Consequences and References are Level 3. ADRs are typically short enough to skip Level 4; when they need it, it belongs in an Appendix section.
- **`CLAUDE.md`.** The one-paragraph project overview is Level 1. The Agent Usage and Toolchain sections are Level 2. Build commands, lint troubleshooting, commit conventions are Level 3. No Level 4.
- **`docs/tdd-principles.md`.** The opening executive summary paragraph is Level 1. The TDD Cycle and Design Check Gate sections are Level 2. Red/Green/Refactor phase rules, Quality Gate, and Document Ownership are Level 3. No Level 4.

Apply the rules when writing new sections and when reviewing drift. The most common failure is starting a new section with implementation detail and no Level 1 paragraph — when reviewing, look at the first 200 words of each top-level heading and ask: does a non-specialist understand the purpose, conclusion, and scope from this alone?

## Document Ownership

### CLAUDE.md (Meta Level)

### docs/system-design.md (Tactical Level)

**Owns:**
- Go conventions for this project (prescriptive style examples)
- Architectural invariants and guardrails
- Package structure (file paths)
- Domain model (Domain-Driven Design classification)
- One-paragraph purpose summary per type, interface, and key function, with a source file pointer
- Design-contract prose: pipeline position, ordering invariants, atomicity rules, fail-secure behavior
- Implementation order (ID, Name, Depends On columns)
- State machine tables and transitions
- Concurrency patterns
- Checklists for adding new components

**Does not own:**
- Type definitions (→ source code is the source of truth)
- Interface definitions (→ source code is the source of truth)
- Constant values and their literals (→ source code is the source of truth)
- Struct field tables: rows of `| Field | Type | Description |` (→ read the struct in source)
- Function parameter tables: rows of `| Parameter | Type | Description |` (→ read the signature in source)
- Exhaustive iptables/SQL/shell rule listings (→ the production code is the only authoritative listing)
- JSON request/response field walkthroughs (→ the adapter code is authoritative)
- HTTP client settings tables that duplicate the code constructing the client (→ cite the ADR invariant instead)
- Why decisions were made (→ ADRs)
- What should be built (→ PRD)
- Build commands (→ CLAUDE.md)

**Abstraction rule:** system-design.md describes design artifacts: contracts, invariants, ordering rules, atomicity guarantees, and fail-secure behaviors. It names each type, interface, and function once, says what contract it holds and which requirement it implements, and points at the source file. It does not replicate field lists, parameter lists, constant literals, or rule listings that already live in source — those rot silently when code changes and add no design information the reader cannot get from Godoc or `grep`.

**Self-test before adding content to system-design.md:** read the paragraph you are about to add and ask "if I renamed a field, added a parameter, or changed a constant in source, would this paragraph become wrong without anyone noticing?" If yes, the paragraph is at the wrong level — either delete it (source is authoritative) or rewrite it as an invariant that survives the rename (e.g. "the rewrite is atomic: temp file in the same directory, fsync, rename" instead of listing the function's parameters).

**Example — wrong level (delete):**

```markdown
### UpOptions

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `WorkspaceFolder` | `string` | Absolute path to the host workspace. |
| `Config` | `config.Config` | Fully resolved config. |
| ... 11 more rows ...
```

**Example — right level (keep):**

```markdown
### UpOptions

Value object carrying every parameter `container.Up` needs: the resolved
workspace set, the post-substitution config, network and mount policy,
resource limits, and injected seams (symlink resolver, confirm callback)
for testability. See `internal/container/up.go`.

**Implements:** REQ-CO-002, REQ-MF-001, REQ-RL-001, REQ-NR-001
```

## Cross-Reference Rules

### PRD References

When PRD mentions a constraint value:
```markdown
**Constraints:**
- Buffer capacity: 10,000 points (see [system-design.md#constants](system-design.md#constants))
```

When PRD depends on a design decision:
```markdown
**Design Rationale:** See [ADR: Title](adr/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md)
```

### system-design.md References

When system-design.md references a requirement implementation:
```markdown
**Implements:** REQ-XX-001, REQ-XX-002

See `internal/example/client.go` for the `SomeInterface` interface.
```

When system-design.md follows an ADR:
```markdown
## Section

Per [ADR: Decision Title](adr/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md), the system does X.
```

### ADR References

Each ADR must include an Implementation section with linked requirements:
```markdown
## Implementation

**Requirements:** REQ-XX-002, REQ-YY-002

## References

- [system-design.md#section](../system-design.md#section) — description
- [REQ-XX-002: Name](../prd.md#req-xx-002)
```

Note: Use em-dashes (—) to separate links from descriptions, not hyphens.

## Maintenance Rules

### When Adding a Feature

1. **PRD:** Add requirement with ID, status, contracts, constraints, acceptance criteria
2. **ADR:** Create ADR if architectural decision involved (new pattern, trade-off, rejection of alternatives)
3. **system-design.md:** Add summaries, patterns, constants reference, implementation notes
4. **CLAUDE.md:** Update only if build commands or workflow changes

### When Changing a Constraint

1. **Source code:** Update constant value (authoritative). Update system-design.md reference if needed.
2. **PRD:** Verify constraint reference still valid
3. **ADR:** Create new ADR if change represents architectural decision

### When Fixing a Bug

1. **Code:** Fix the bug
2. **PRD:** Only update if acceptance criteria was wrong
3. **system-design.md:** Only update if implementation pattern changes
4. **ADR:** Only create if fix represents architectural decision

### Agent Guidelines

Agents must:
- Read PRD requirements before implementing
- Reference system-design.md for types and interfaces
- Check ADRs for design constraints before proposing alternatives
- Never duplicate type definitions across documents
- Never add pseudocode or Go code to PRD (use contracts only)
- Never add Go-specific constructs to PRD (channels, goroutines, function signatures)
- Never reference internal code in PRD (no function names, variable names, or control flow keywords)
- Use behavioral language in PRD ("the system retries the operation" not "`Retry()` calls `continue`")
- When PRD needs to reference implementation details, add a link: `**Implementation:** See [system-design.md#section](system-design.md#section)`

## Prohibited Patterns

| Pattern | Severity | Solution |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Implementation pseudocode in PRD | **Critical** | Move to system-design.md, link from PRD |
| Go code blocks in PRD | **Critical** | Move to system-design.md, link from PRD |
| Go-specific constructs in PRD (channels, goroutines, function signatures) | **High** | Describe behavior in PRD, mechanism in system-design.md |
| Internal code references in PRD (function names, variable names, control flow) | **High** | Use behavioral language |
| Algorithm formulas in PRD | **High** | State behavioral constraints in PRD, move formulas to system-design.md |
| Duplicated type definitions | **High** | Source code is the source of truth; reference source files |
| Struct field tables in system-design.md (`\| Field \| Type \| Description \|`) | **High** | Replace with a one-paragraph purpose summary and a `See source.go` pointer |
| Function parameter tables in system-design.md (`\| Parameter \| Type \| Description \|`) | **High** | Describe the contract in prose; the signature lives in source |
| Constant literal values in system-design.md | **High** | Name the constant and cite the source file; do not copy the value |
| Exhaustive rule listings in system-design.md (iptables, SQL, shell) | **Medium** | State the invariant ("default-deny plus loopback/established/DNS/allowed IPs"); source is authoritative for order |
| Hardcoded constants in PRD | **Medium** | Reference system-design.md |
| "Why" explanations in system-design.md | **Medium** | Create ADR |
| Implementation details in ADR | **Medium** | Reference system-design.md |
| Build commands in PRD | **Medium** | Keep in CLAUDE.md |
| Hyphens in ADR reference lists | **Medium** | Use em-dashes (—) |
| Version numbers in documents | **Medium** | Use git for versioning; no "Version: 1.0" fields |

## Agent Optimization Guidelines

All documentation in `docs/` is optimized for consumption by AI agents. Follow these rules to maintain parseability.

### Structural Requirements

| Rule | Rationale | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| HTML anchors for requirement IDs | Stable linking across heading changes | `<a id="req-xx-001"></a>` before heading |
| No version numbers | Git handles versioning | Remove "Version: 1.0" fields |
| Tables over prose lists | Structured data is extractable | Use tables for constraints, not bullets |
| ASCII art diagrams informational only | Cannot be parsed programmatically | Use tables for state transitions |
| Language tags on code blocks | Enables syntax detection | ` ```go` not ` ``` ` |
| Em-dashes for list separators | Distinguishes link from description | `[Link](url) — description` |

### Reference Format

Use consistent cross-reference format throughout:

```markdown
# Within same document
See [Section Name](#section-name)

# To another document (from docs/ subdirectory)
See [prd.md#req-xx-001](prd.md#req-xx-001)

# From ADR to PRD requirement
[REQ-XX-002: Name](../prd.md#req-xx-002)

# From ADR to system-design section (with description)
[Constants](../system-design.md#constants) — `DefaultTimeout`, `MaxRetries`

# Inline requirement reference
Implements REQ-XX-001
```

Note: Anchor IDs use lowercase with hyphens. For requirements, use the short ID anchor (e.g., `#req-xx-002`).

### Parseable Section Templates

**Requirement (PRD):**
```markdown
<a id="req-xx-nnn"></a>
### REQ-XX-NNN: Name

[One sentence description]

**Status:** Approved | Proposed | Deprecated

**Design Rationale:**
- [ADR: Title](adr/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md)

**Input:**
- `param` (type): Description

**Output:**
- `result` (type): Description

**Behavior:**
[Prose description. No code, no Go constructs, no internal function names. Describe what happens, not how.]

**Implementation:** See [system-design.md#section](system-design.md#section)

**Constraints:** (values in [system-design.md#constants](system-design.md#constants))
- Constraint name: `ConstantName` (value)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Given X, when Y, then Z
2. Given A, when B, then C

**Depends On:** REQ-XX-NNN, REQ-YY-MMM
```

Note: HTML anchors (`<a id="...">`) enable stable linking. Anchor IDs use lowercase with hyphens.

**ADR Structure:**
```markdown
## Implementation

**Requirements:** REQ-XX-NNN, REQ-YY-MMM

## References

- [system-design.md#section](../system-design.md#section) — description
- [REQ-XX-NNN: Name](../prd.md#req-xx-nnn-name)
```

Note: For ADRs relating to non-goals, use `**Non-goal:** NG-X` instead of Requirements.

**State Transitions (system-design.md):**
```markdown
**State Flow (parseable format):**

| # | From | Event | To |
|---|------|-------|----|
| 1 | (start) | Connect() called | CONNECTING |
| 2 | CONNECTING | Success | CONNECTED |
| 3 | CONNECTING | Failure | DISCONNECTED |

**Visual representation (informational only):**
[ASCII diagram here - not parsed by agents]
```

Note: Tables are the authoritative format for state machines. ASCII diagrams are supplementary.

### Validation Checklist

Before merging documentation changes, verify all three categories below. The `doc-reviewer` agent (`.claude/agents/doc-reviewer.md`) automates these checks. The `/lint-docs` command invokes the same checks on demand.

#### Structural Checks

- [ ] All requirement IDs have HTML anchors (`<a id="req-xx-nnn"></a>`)
- [ ] No implementation pseudocode in PRD
- [ ] No Go code blocks (` ```go `) in PRD
- [ ] No Go-specific constructs in PRD (channels, goroutines, function signatures, internal code references)
- [ ] All cross-references use full paths with anchors
- [ ] Tables have headers and consistent column counts
- [ ] No relative references ("above", "below", "previous")
- [ ] No version numbers in documents (git handles versioning)
- [ ] ADR References use em-dashes (—) to separate links from descriptions
- [ ] ADR Implementation section includes **Requirements:** or **Non-goal:**
- [ ] Code blocks have language tags (` ```go ` not ` ``` `)

#### Cross-Document Coherence Checks

- [ ] Every REQ-XX-NNN in system-design.md exists in prd.md. Deprecated requirements absent from system-design.md.
- [ ] Constants referenced in prd.md are defined in system-design.md Constants section.
- [ ] All document links between prd.md and system-design.md resolve to valid anchors.

#### Abstraction Level Checks (system-design.md)

- [ ] No struct field tables (`| Field | Type | Description |` rows). Purpose paragraph plus source pointer instead.
- [ ] No function parameter tables (`| Parameter | Type | Description |` rows). Contract prose plus source pointer instead.
- [ ] No constant literal values. Name the constant, cite the source file.
- [ ] No exhaustive iptables/SQL/shell rule listings. State the invariant; source is authoritative for order.
- [ ] Self-test: for each paragraph, would a field rename / parameter addition / constant change in source silently invalidate it? If yes, rewrite or delete.

#### Structure Within a Document Checks

Per [Structure Within a Document](#structure-within-a-document):

- [ ] Each top-level heading opens with a Level 1 paragraph (≤200 words, narrative prose, no jargon) that states purpose, conclusion, and scope.
- [ ] A non-specialist can read the first 200 words of any major section and walk away with a useful understanding.
- [ ] No section jumps from Level 1 to Level 3 with more than a 5× length ratio — insert a Level 2 bridge when the gap is larger.
- [ ] Each level is self-contained: no forward references ("as explained in Section 3 below") required to understand the current level.
- [ ] Lower-level sections may use lists, tables, and diagrams, but Level 1 paragraphs are prose.

#### Writing Standards Checks

Per [Writing Standards](#writing-standards) above:

- [ ] No prohibited words without data: "significant", "substantial", "remarkable", "arguably", "might", "would help", "should result in", "some", "many", "most", "several", "various", "often", "usually", "probably", "very", "extremely", "fairly", "quite"
- [ ] No vague adjectives without data (replace with measurements)
- [ ] Sentences under 30 words maximum; 70% under 20 words
- [ ] No wordy phrases ("due to the fact that" → "because")
- [ ] Every paragraph passes the "So what?" test
- [ ] Answers start with the answer, not warmup
- [ ] Acronyms defined on first use
- [ ] No subjective language or buzzwords
